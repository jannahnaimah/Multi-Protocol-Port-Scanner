# Multi-Protocol Port Scanner

Small Python tool for scanning ports across multiple protocols (TCP/UDP/ICMP/etc.).

## About

This is a personal mini project that implements a simple multi-protocol port scanner. The project is intended for education and authorized network testing only — do not use it on networks where you don't have permission to test.

## Quick start

1. Install Python 3.8+.
2. Place your scanner script (e.g., `Multi-Protocol Port Scanner.py`) in this repository.
3. Run the scanner:

```powershell
python "Multi-Protocol Port Scanner.py"
```

## Features (suggested)

- TCP connect scans
- UDP scans
- ICMP ping sweeps
- Concurrent scanning using threads or asyncio
- Output to CSV or JSON

## Contributing

Open issues or PRs if you'd like help adding features, tests, or CI.
